                            <p>Soto Banjar is a typical soto dish from South Kalimantan with the main ingredients of ketupat and chicken. This soto contains shredded chicken, potato croquettes, boiled eggs, and pieces of ketupat. There are vermicelli or glass noodles as a complement. Soto Banjar is often served for breakfast or dinner, especially in Banjarmasin and its surrounding areas. It is sold in food stalls and restaurants. Soto Banjar vendors usually also serve chicken satay as a side dish. Nasi sop is the name for soto Banjar, whose main ingredient is rice. Soto Banjar is thought to have appeared after 1563, with the arrival of Chinese traders in Banjarmasin, which at the end of the 16th century was known as a pepper-producing kingdom and part of the Indonesian Spice Route. The culinary delights of "jao to" (as soto was called at that time) began to enter Banjarmasin during this period.</p>

                            <p>Manday or mandai is a type of alternative dish from the South and Central Kalimantan regions. Mandai is also called mandai basanga or mandai baoseng, which is fried or saut√©ed cempedak fruit skin or jackfruit skin. Banjar people usually call this cempedak skin food manday, but some also call it dami, also known as wadi tiwadak because of the fermented cempedak skin (wadi). As a food made from fruit peel, mandai reflects the local wisdom of the people of Kalimantan in maximizing food utilization. Furthermore, mandai has economic value because it can be processed into high-value products. Besides being a delicious dish, mandai is also high in fiber because it comes from the fruit peel. Fermentation during the soaking process can enhance the flavor and extend the shelf life of mandai without additional preservatives.</p>

                            <p>Mutiara Soup is a traditional dish from South Kalimantan that symbolizes the cultural blend between the Peranakan Chinese and the Banjar community. Its name comes from the small chicken balls that resemble pearls. The soup has a savory and creamy taste, created from chicken broth enriched with evaporated milk, and is complemented with carrots, peas, and sausage. Commonly served during Chinese New Year and other festive occasions, Mutiara Soup represents togetherness and harmony. In modern variations, mushrooms or other vegetables are sometimes added.</p>

                            <p>Mie Bancir is noodles served with a ‚Äúhalfway‚Äù broth (nyemek). Its name comes from the fact that the dish is considered ‚Äúin-between‚Äù or ‚Äúhalf-half.‚Äù The broth is not as much as in soup, yet not dry like fried noodles. Mie Bancir offers a unique noodle taste. Its spice-rich broth blends perfectly with yellow noodles and additional components such as shredded chicken, boiled egg, and fried shallots. This dish originates from Banjarmasin, South Kalimantan, and is a favorite among locals for breakfast or as a late-night meal. The savory broth is usually enriched with garlic, shallots, pepper, and a touch of lime to enhance freshness. Mie Bancir is often sold in humble food stalls and has become one of Banjarmasin‚Äôs culinary icons, showcasing the region‚Äôs love for flavorful yet balanced dishes.</p>

This dish is usually accompanied by side dishes such as boiled eggs, fried chicken, and ikan haruan (snakehead fish), making it a complete and hearty meal. Often served during festive occasions and family gatherings, Nasi Kuning Bumbu Habang reflects the Banjar community‚Äôs culinary identity, where vibrant colors and bold flavors come together in harmony.</p>

                            <p>Ketupat Kandangan is a traditional dish originating from the Kandangan area in South Kalimantan, but it is also commonly found in Banjarmasin. Like ketupat in general, it is made from rice. What makes Ketupat Kandangan different from other types of ketupat is the use of snakehead fish (haruan) as the main side dish. The fish is first grilled and then cooked in coconut milk, before being served over the ketupat along with its rich sauce. This dish can be enjoyed for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Ketupat Kandangan has a savory and slightly spicy taste, with a blend of local spices that enrich both the aroma and flavor. In Banjar culinary tradition, dishes made with snakehead fish are often served during various ceremonies and celebrations, such as Eid al-Fitr and wedding processions. Its presence not only symbolizes togetherness but also expresses gratitude in Banjar culture.    </p>

                            <p>Cacapan Asam is a traditional dish from Banjarmasin, made from sour-tasting fruits such as young mangoes. In addition to young mangoes, other fruits that can be used include belimbing wuluh (bilimbi), lime, limau kuit (a local citrus), binjai (wild mango), and gandaria. Gandaria, however, is a seasonal fruit that only bears fruit once a year, so it can only be used during its season. Cacapan Asam is typically served as a side dish or condiment, often paired with grilled or fried fish. It is commonly eaten with fish such as betok (climbing perch), haruan (snakehead fish), and other local freshwater fish. This dish combines a refreshing sourness with a touch of spiciness from chili, sometimes mixed with shallots, shrimp paste (terasi), salt, and sugar to balance the flavor. In Banjar cuisine, Cacapan Asam functions much like a dipping sauce or sambal, enhancing the taste of the main dish while also providing a fresh and tangy contrast.</p>

Made from rice flour, coconut milk, brown sugar, and suji leaves, it has a soft and chewy texture with a mildly sweet taste. The wrapping also holds a symbolic meaning in Banjar philosophy: not everything in life should be revealed. Usually enjoyed for breakfast or served at weddings and community rituals, Babungku is also found in other regions like East and Central Kalimantan, Central Maluku, and West Sumatra under different names.</p>

                                Amparan tatak is a traditional cake typical of the Banjar people in South Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan, East Kalimantan and Tembilahan, Riau. This cake is included in the wet cake category with the main ingredients being rice flour, coconut milk, sugar and banana. This cake is dominated by savory and sweet flavors, making it one of the most sought-after snacks in the cake market during the month of Ramadan. This cake is similar to nagasari, but the difference lies in its presentation. Nagasari is served wrapped in banana leaves, while amparan tatak is served in a large baking pan and is generally cut into triangles.
